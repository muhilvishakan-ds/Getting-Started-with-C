Hello to whoever reading this! This is my kickstart to learn C language and being consistent in learning and executing it, I've this curiosity to learn this language while my friends are learning python & java, Where C maded me to feel like **"Iron Man"** (Tony Stark From Marvel) to build functions, libs from scratch. Well i just did 2 programs in C and im talking like this, well this **"Read Me"** file will be updated daily with dates so you all could know my progress in here, so for now see you soon guyss!!

Hello To All once again, so today i have uploaded around 4 programs wehre i have learnt about looping (while & for) the same program of listing out fahrenheit and celsius temparature, i have fascinated about how these looping works and especially the** FOR Loop** this guys reduced the size of a 14 line program using while to a 6 line program when i used him, i also i came to know about "**ACCESS SPECIFIERS"** such as %f and digit spaces too i.e %6d which means its provides a space of 6 digits. Also about including numbers after point by using %.2f(which inl 2 digits after point) , %.1f(which includes a digit after point). 
Also i learned about a new concept called symbolic representation which are like variables but its syntax goes like <#define NAME VALUE(Can be numeric or char)> eg: #define AGE 19, I've used this in the temparature program. And im so happy that i myself did a reverse program on this temperature using FOR Loop this was so satisfying to me!!!! SO Thats all For today ig(Who knows my curiosity will solve 5 more problems today and will post a repo here and could update here) bye for now See you guyss Later!!!!
